## Technology
Ruby on Rails handles the backend data management. ES6, React and Redux create a fun, dynamic and seamless experience on the frontend.
 
## Features

User-Authentication - Users have peace of mind setting their account as their email and password. The password is never saved on the back-end to ensure security. It renders the appropriate errors to help guide users.


User-experience- Components are clearly and logically labelled to create and easy and fun experience

## Future
Add tags. Better quill. The note body stays up when you click on it and can edit it in there. Clears and renders new note body when new one is clicked. Drop downs. Errors. Handle refreshes better
